I have managed to qualify for the first team of Technical University of Varna and took part in the XXXV-Republican-Academic-Programming-Olympiad. I was in the first team(TUV_1) along with two colleagues - Angel Rizanov and Yavor Stoyanov. Technical University of Varna was represented by a total of 3 teams(TUV_1, TUV_2, TUV_3). All teams were leaded by Mrs. Neli Kalcheva and Mr. Ivelin Kovachev. TUV_1 solved successfully 3 tasks. At the end of the competition our second team (TUV_2) earned 3rd place for Technical University of Varna in the final ranking among the best universities in Bulgaria.
